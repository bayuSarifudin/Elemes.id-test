# Skill test Elemes Id
in this app I got the design from here
- [figma](https://www.figma.com/file/VXBvQvCeLRs65i4cLhihEi/Frontend-Test?node-id=0%3A1)

## technology used
I am using Vite template react typecript with TailwindCss as the CSS framework, here is for the detail
- node version = 20.0.0,
- npm version = 9.6.4,
- react version = ^18.2.15,
- tailwind version = ^3.3.5

if the node and npm version is not compatible, you can use nvm to adjust the version, [read here](https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm)

## Set up and Instalation
first you can clone the repo into your local machine first by using
```
git clone --the repo url--
```
and then you can change directory to the cloned repo and start installing all of the dependencies by running this command
```
cd Elemes.id-test
npm install
```
or if you want to make sure the instalation is not failed, you can use
```
cd Elemes.id-test
npm install --legacy-peer-deps
```

## Run the App and start Developing
- Run this CLI to start the app

```bash
npm run dev
```
- Run this CLI to build the production-app

```bash
